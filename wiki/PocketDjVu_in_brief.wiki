#summary PocketDjVu.

= Introduction =

PocketDjVu the small DjVu files reader for Windows Mobile devices.
It was started for personal need because of lack such applications for my PDA.
At the moment when I bought my Dell Axim X51v I found only one commercial DjVu reader for Windows Mobile. Unneeded to say that its quality was awful.
After several months later I came across on DjvuCE project on the Source Forge superb site.
A lot of greetings to its author for making djvulibre (i.e. open source library for djvu format) working on Windows Mobile. But interface in available version (0.9 at that time) was far from ideal and reading was very inconvenient thing.
That's why I decided to create my own GUI frontend based on djvulibre.
